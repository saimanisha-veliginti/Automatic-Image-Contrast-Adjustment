# Automatic-Image-Contrast-Adjustment
This project enhances image contrast automatically using a hybrid approach that combines digital image processing (DIP) and machine learning (ML) techniques. It applies traditional contrast methods with ML-based optimization to produce natural, high-quality images for applications like medical imaging and photography.
